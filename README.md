# Tic-Tac-Toe Web Project

## Overview

A fully modular, web-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. Built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, it supports Human vs Human, Human vs AI, and AI vs AI modes — featuring dynamic strategies, modular architecture, and an evolving AI.

But this isn't just Tic-Tac-Toe.

It's a **fully operational neon deathmatch machine**, straight outta a 1980s futurepunk arcade. Grab a name, flick the AI switch, and step into the glow.

## 🧠 AI Strategies

| Strategy    | Description                                                |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `random`    | Selects moves randomly                                     |
| `greedy`    | Prioritizes immediate wins; otherwise, picks randomly      |
| `minimax`   | Uses recursive search for optimal moves (unbeatable)       |
| `humanlike` | Alternates between strategies to mimic human-like behavior |

## 🛠️ Technologies
